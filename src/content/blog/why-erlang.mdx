I often hear people say that Erlang is great, but I never really understood why. This post is an exploration I did to try to understand what is great about it.

## The Basics

First, let's establish what Erlang/OTP is exactly.

The OTP in "Erlang/OTP" stands for "Open Telecom Platform", which makes sense since it was developped
at Ericsson. It's designed to run in high-scalability high-availability requirements.

Erlang is both a programming language _and_ a runtime.
Erlang source code is converted into bytecode, which is run on the Erlang VM.
The VM provides the runtime and everything that is required by it, such as garbage collection.
It also includes a JIT module to make it fast, powered by [asmjit](https://github.com/asmjit/asmjit).

The current Erlang VM is called BEAM, which stood for _"Bogdan's Erlang Abstract Machine"_, and now stands
for _"BjÃ¶rn's Erlang Abstract Machine"_. Which were respectively the first and second maintainers. Let's
say it's a good thing I've never been the maintainer of the Erlang VM or the name would have been very
unfortunate.

Architecturally, Erlang is quite similar to Java.

Erlang is written in C/C++, with large parts of the compiler & runtime written in Erlang itself.

## Running stuff

To give a very basic example of how it all ties together, let's run a simple hello world program.
Defining a module looks like this:


```erlang
% hello.erl
-module(hello).
-export([world/0]).

world() -> io:format("Hello, world\n").
```

And running it looks like this:

```sh
# Compile the source code:
$ erlc hello.erl
# It creates the bytecode at "./hello.beam"
# And then we can run the bytecode on the VM:
$ erl -noshell -s hello world -s init stop
```

## Garbage collection

> Erlang manages dynamic memory with a tracing garbage collector. More precisely a per process generational semi-space copying collector using Cheney's copy collection algorithm together with a global large object space. (See C. J. Cheney in References.)
